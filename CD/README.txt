The CD-ROM provides all the necessary codes for the numerical
experiments presented in the textbook. They are collected in separated
directories corresponding to their chapters.

The authors think that the reader of the book shouldn't check some of
the code if he/she feels too impatient to get his/her own version. So
some of the key programs are compiled into p-code with Matlab 7.6,
which might lead to compatibility problems if you are using one whose
version is earlier than 7.4. In this case, please find what you need
in the src/ directory.
